:::info About this list

This list is **curated and subjective** - it contains projects and products that I personally recommend and enjoy. The GameCube modding scene is very active, with new projects appearing regularly, so this list may not always reflect the latest developments.

If you know of a modification or project that should be included here, feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/webhdx/support/issues) with your suggestion.
