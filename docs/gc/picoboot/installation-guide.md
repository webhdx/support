# Install PicoBoot

:::danger Firmware Version Warning
A small percentage of **v0.4** firmware users reported reliability issues. If you experience problems, please use v0.3.x firmware instead:
- Download the latest v0.3.x release from [GitHub](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/releases/tag/v0.3.1)
- Wire PicoBoot according to [legacy v0.3 wiring diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/refs/tags/v0.3/assets/Wiring%20diagram.jpg)
:::

:::warning Soldering Experience Required
PicoBoot is considered an easy soldering modification. However, there is significant evidence online showing that inexperienced users can easily damage their console beyond repair. Do not overestimate your soldering skills. Practice soldering on scrap electronics before attempting this installation.

## Installation Steps

### Flash the Raspberry Pi Pico
1. Download correct UF2 file from [the latest release](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/releases/latest)
   - `picoboot_full_pico.uf2`: if you are using Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W board
   - `picoboot_full_pico2.uf2`: if you are using Raspberry Pi Pico 2 or Pico 2 W board
2. Hold `BOOTSEL` button and connect the board to your computer
3. Look for `RPI-RP2` or `RP2350` mass storage device
4. Drag and drop `*.uf2` file onto the device
5. Wait for automatic ejection and green LED confirmation
6. Unplug USB cable

### Prepare the SD Card
1. Format SD card to FAT32 or exFAT
2. Download the latest Swiss version from [releases page](https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc/releases/latest)
3. Rename `swiss_rXXXX.dol` to `ipl.dol`
4. Copy `ipl.dol` to SD card root directory

### Installation Tips
- Mount PicoBoot on fan assembly or behind front controller plate
- Use only official Raspberry Pi Pico (W) or Pico 2 (W) boards
- For heatsink removal:
  - Warm up console by playing a game for 10-15 minutes
  - Gently twist heatsink back and forth, be careful not to damage DA15 component on the motherboard
  - Avoid using prying tools
- After installation:
  - Console should boot directly to Swiss or stop on gekkoboot debug screen
  - If you see stock GameCube menu or nothing displays, refer to [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md)
